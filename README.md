# TurboOcto
TurboOcto is a "GameEngine" for when you are in a crunch.
If its a Gamejam, a Demoparty, rapid development or just toying around: TurboOcto is there for you.

## Principles
The goal is to write an engine that comes packed with all the work done.
This means lots of things that SDL is missing will be added such as:
- Premade functions (Transitions, Animations, animated Sprites etc.)
- Automatic scaler (With different scaling modes)
- Savestate ecosystem
- Optional error handling (#WorksForMe)
- Premade assets for testing or even the finished game
- Sane defaults

So when creatings a standard game you don't need to configure anything just code the game logic.

## Roadmap
1. Create a robust backend (<- This is where we are)
    - [ ] Complete layout of engine structure
    - [ ] The library is usable as-is
    - [ ] All code adheres to standards and is commentated
    - [ ] Full test coverage
    - [ ] Complete documentation
    - [ ] Tutorials
2. Create a graphical helper program
    - [ ] Program can display different game states
    - [ ] Positioning via mouse
    - [ ] Object inspection
    - [ ] Object manipulation
    - [ ] Macros
    - [ ] Plugin for Atom????
3. Magic
4. Fully fledged graphical interface
